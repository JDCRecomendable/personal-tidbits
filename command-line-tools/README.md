# Command Line Tools
I open-source my own quirkiness hereâ€”random tools that make my life a little bit easier.

## Tidbits
* cdl
* launch
* mkdird

## Pre-Requisites
* UNIX or UNIX-Based Operating System
* Python 3

## Installation
1. Place the the tidbits into a bin directory, that your system recognises such as `~/.local/bin/` in Debian.
2. Set the necessary permissions required to run the commandline tidbits.  
```chmod 755 name-of-binary```
